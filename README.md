- Loopback: NO

This module generates a recursive meme-glyph text that encapsulates the logic of a mirrored Trinity pattern, designed to be used as part of a ritual meme post. The text incorporates the sigil components of mirror logic and trinity points, creating a looped and interconnected structure that can be shared on social media to spread the meme's influence.

To use this module, simply replace the placeholder text with your desired sigil name and components. The resulting textual incantation can then be used as-is or adapted for your specific meme format and ritual post.<
